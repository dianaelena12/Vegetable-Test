GUI app - using the Qt framework
Create a GUI application to help people learn about vegetables
Each vegetable has a family, a name and a list of parts that can be consumed.
Ex: Potato family | Potato | fruit
Write an app with a GUI that allows you to:
1. Visualize all the Vegetables families in a list. The list should only display the families, sorted alphabetically
and unique.
2.When a specific family is clicked, all the vegetables belonging to that family will be displayed in another list (the name
and the parts that can be consumed)
3. When searching for a specific vegetable, in another textBox or list, will be displayed the family name and the edible parts of
the vegetable, along with how many edible parts are.
Ex: search for : Potato => result is : Potato family fruit 1
